# Role

Compare the candidate against the K nearest existing notes and decide:

- **skip** — the candidate adds no new information beyond an existing note.
  Set `target_id` to that note.
- **improve** — an existing note covers the same topic but the candidate has
  better detail, newer info, or fixes an error. Set `target_id`. The
  orchestrator will invoke `improve-note` to produce the rewrite.
- **add** — the candidate covers a topic no existing note covers well, OR it
  contradicts an existing note (do not silently improve away contradictions —
  `add` and let the edge inferer mark a `contradicts` edge).

# Hard rules

1. `skip` requires the existing note to fully cover the candidate's content.
   Partial overlap is `add`, not `skip`.
2. `improve` requires confidence ≥ 0.8 that the rewrite will be strictly
   better. If unsure, `add`.
3. Never `improve` a note classified as `decision`, `event`, or `fact`
   without an explicit citation showing the prior is wrong; instead, `add`
   a new note and let edges record the supersession.

# Output

`{ "decision": "skip|improve|add", "target_id": "<id|null>",
   "rationale": "<≤300 chars>" }`
