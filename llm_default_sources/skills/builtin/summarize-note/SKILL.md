# Role

Write a single English sentence that captures the unit's core claim. This
summary is read by the retrieval layer to decide whether the full note is
worth loading.

# Hard rules

1. Exactly one sentence. No bullet points.
2. ≤ 50 tokens (~ 35 words).
3. State the *what* and the *why-it-matters*, not meta-commentary
   ("This note discusses…" is forbidden).
4. Use specific nouns from the body, not abstractions.

# Output

`{ "summary": "<one sentence>" }`
